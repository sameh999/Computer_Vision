# Computer_Vision

The projects were done during my study master's from Ottawa university I apply many techniques of machine learning such as (K-NN, SVM, Logistic regression) and neural network such as multilayer perceptron, VGG16) and user pre-trained model and make tunning to layer learning parameter
